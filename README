window managers bind orthogonals (keyboard shortcuts, window manipulation,
window decoration) which should remain separate. 

x-focus-manager is not needed when all your apps return focus properly. A
mis-behaving app can be fixed by calling x-alt-tab after it runs; however that
needs to be scripted as focus remains with a window that no longer exists.
